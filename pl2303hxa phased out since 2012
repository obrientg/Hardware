I fell into the "pl2303hxa phased out since 2012" issue today, needing to access two #Fortinet #FG-80C devices (to confirm they worked, ensure they had the default UID/password and configs, etc.)

So I grabbed the trusty #serial to #USB dongle and a crossover cable - it was a #cisco labeled one even. 

Went to use my #Thinkpad running #win11 and after updating the drivers using Windows update received the dreaded "pl2303hxa phased out since 2012, please contact your supplier" message - and would not tell you what #COM port was configured. 

Well, #WTH ?!?

Some further research has two theories on the motives by #Prolific (the makers of the #chipset supposedly used in the #dongle ) 
1) Prolific wants to sell more hardware. Which, get bent Prolific, nice way to backdate planned obsolescence 
2) Seems a ton of fake, cheap dongles use a fake chipset based on Prolific's design. Prolific released a driver that identifies these cables, and will not allow the use of their driver for these fake dongles. 

Again, go get bent Prolific. I can relate to the issues involved here, but go after the fakes not your customer base. I have no idea how long this dongle has been in my toolbox, or where it came from - and I'm certainly not going to throw away a perfectly good dongle. 

There is a solution, follow along on this #github page and install their driver from 2008 that does not conduct this chipset check. All will work fine.
