Google Wifi "puck" (AC-1304)

There is also a "HD2" also known as a GJ2CQ. Unlike the AC-1304 it does not use a USB-C for power, but a DC barrel input (14V@1.1A) instead. According to the OpenWRT wiki installation on the GJ2CQ requires soldering a USB port to four test points located on the PCB and using a screwdriver to short the unpopulated SW7 contacts at the appropriate time during installation. Thankfully I only have one of these, and I'll save it till last. 

If you follow the directions between these links:  
https://openwrt.org/toh/google/wifi 
and with the updated details in this thread https://forum.openwrt.org/t/finally-installed-openwrt-on-my-google-wifi-ac-1304/183541/2 you can get OpenWRT installed on these "pucks" (AC-1304).

Then, if you want to use some of those as repeaters, then follow this tutorial 
https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/relay_configuration 
and the video at

I will say, the boot process and intial webUI is really slow. Once you get logged in, it works ok. 

This are 802.11AC on the 5Ghz, so they should work well as wiFi repeaters (I hope).
