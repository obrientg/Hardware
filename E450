The next thinkpad on my workbench is an E450 – I grabbed this from ewaste to provide a family member a better laptop. It has a i5-5200U at 2.2Ghz, and a max 16GB of DDR3L RAM so it can/should run Win11, Linux, or BSD with ease. The IO is ok, with multiple USB3 ports, HDMI, ethernet and a memory card reader. This is a decent form factor, weight, and would make a decent laptop for someone. Though no docking station capabilities, they removed the port underneath.  

There is a big BUT with this laptop though: it keeps freezing, and the video is glitching. Which may be why it went to ewaste…

I upgraded the DDR3L RAM to 16GB, and wiped the 500GB SSD that came with it.  
Starting installing Win11, and I let it install and reboot so I could refill my tea – to come back and the laptop was frozen with a black screen. 
I rebooted, and it froze on the initial Win11 change password screen. 
I rebooted again, went into the Lenovo BIOS diagnostic tool, and started the full tests. As the test were running, I touched the nub and the video started glitching. Letting the test continue, the laptop froze while testing.  

So, is this beyond time & effort to get working – pull the spare parts and move on from?
