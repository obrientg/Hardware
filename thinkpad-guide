In researching a #thinkpad I have on the workbench, came across a reference to this purchasing #ThinkPad guide. Sadly the web site is down, but it is on archive.org (this is the last update before the site went down that I can find). It aligns with the recommendations from the local vintage computing group - thanks for sharing the knowledge
